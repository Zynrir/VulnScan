# VulnScan
It is a Bash script that implements a vulnerability scanning tool. It allows performing various actions related to network scanning and vulnerability assessment. Users can verify the operating system of an IP address, perform TCP and UDP port scans, extract information from the scans performed, perform vulnerability scans on specific ports and extract information about the vulnerabilities found.

Administrator permissions are required.

Thanks to @s4vitar as I have taken 2 functions from his script:
